#Script In Progress....
#
#
#
#SafeMalwareCollection.ps1
#
#This script is to be used with Microsoft 365 Defender Live Response to quickly and safely collect malicious files for analysis. 
#The first part of the script prompts you for the filename. 
#The second part searches for the file and displays information about the file. 
#The third part defangs the file (appending the extension with ".malz").
#The fourth part archives the file into a .zip file (IN-PROGRESS!! Will be adding code to encrypt archive)
#
#Suggestions and optimizations are encouraged. 
#
#1st Part
write-host = "`n"
$filename = $(Write-Host "Please enter the filename to search for: " -ForgroundColor green; Read-Host -Prompt "Enter Filename:"
#
#2nd Part
$getfileloc = GetChildItem -recurse -filter $filename -File -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Path "C:\PATH TO FILE"
Write-Output $getfileloc;
#
Write-Host = "`n"
$answer= Read-Host -Prompt 'Is this the correct file? Press "Y" to continue or Press "N" to cancel'
#
if ($answer -eq "Y"){
write-host("Continuing...") -ForegroundColor green
}else{
Return ("Cancelling...")
